                        <p>
                            Hi, I am Rumy! Some people call me "fox", "cute dog", "red dog from the Internet". But I'm a big,
                            formidable
                            dog,
                            I am Shiba-Inu. And this is a story of my journey. Looking ahead, I will say that unexpectedly, I
                            found myself in a different part of the globe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I had a wonderfully peaceful life in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. Warm couch, delicious food, long
                            walks with
                            my man. By the way, I own four people: a pair of adults and two human puppies. I love my cubs,
                            although
                            sometimes I am ready to devour them. As for adults, well, I would like to learn how to open the
                            frige
                            myself to take my food, and then I can get rid of groun ups. Oh, and there's Sofina, big fluffy
                            mouse of
                            Pomeranian breed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anyway, as I said, I had a pretty good time in Saint-Petersburg…

                        <h2>Before the journey</h2>
                        <p>But suddenly, at the end of February 2022, everything has changed. There was a feeling of depression,
                            anxiety in
                            the family.</p>
                        <p>Something unusual was happening. I was taken to the vet twice; they did tests for antibodies to the
                            rabies
                            virus and a test for leishmaniasis.</p>
                        <p>This went on for a while, and at the beginning of July, my people began to pack their bags. I thought
                            we were
                            going on vacation by car. We've done this before, it was a lot of fun. But this time there were
                            containers
                            for me and Sofina and my people did not rejoice in the coming journey. And then one morning my
                            people loaded
                            the suitcases into the car (and me and Sofina in containers) and went to the airport. I counted 6
                            suitcases, 4
                            hand luggage and 2 dog cages. It wasn't easy for my people to handle all our luggage, but they did
                            it.
                            Luckily, the driver and airport staff were very kind and helpful.</p>
                        <p>We went through all the formalities at the airport and to my displeasure, the airport workers took me
                            and the Sofina and placed us in the luggage compartment of the aircraft.</p>

                            <p>So, my journey has begun. It was dark and noisy inside the plane’s hold. My people put
                                some ice cubes in my
                                watering can and I had water during the flight. We flew by Turkish Airlines, the flight
                                was delayed by 1.5
                                hours, but all the rest went well and after 4 hours flight we arrived to Istanbul.</p>
                            <p>
                                My man later said that he asked the flight attendant several times how the dogs were
                                doing. I doubt this,
                                probably he was just enjoying his flight.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My people left part of bags in the luggage room and we checked into a hotel near the
                                airport. It was warm
                                and good in Istanbul.
                            </p>
                            <p>We spent two nights at the hotel and drove back to the airport. It turned out that in
                                Istanbul there was only
                                a long gap between the flights (40 hours).</p>
                            <p>After a short wait at the airport, Sofina and I were again placed in the luggage
                                compartment of the aircraft.
                                But this time the flight took 17 hours (with a stopover in San Paolo)!!!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, late in the evening we arrived in Buenos Aires. Apparently, my man was tired from
                                the flight, because he
                                forgot one of our suitcases at the airport. Fortunately, he himself realized that the
                                bag was missing and
                                managed to pick it up. Finally, we took all our luggage and spent the night in the
                                hotel in the center of
                                Buenos Aires.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was going to rest at the hotel, but my man explained that we needed to buy tickets for
                                the ferry. It
                                turned out that Buenos Aires was not the final destination of our trip.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The difficulty was that russian bank cards do not work abroad and you cannot buy tickets
                                online. Therefore,
                                we were looking for an ATM that works with the Chinese payment system Union Pay to
                                withdrawal cash.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It appeared, my man did not rest enough, because he forgot his card in the ATM. Luckly,
                                the girl who used
                                the
                                ATM after him caught up with him and returned the card back. In general, we met
                                exceptionally good people
                                along the way. This gives hope that it is not all lost in the human world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then we got to the ferry terminal and bought tickets for everyone. The weather was good,
                                although it was
                                winter in Argentina in July.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The next morning we boarded the ferry and in less than 3 hours we arrived to the capital of Uruguay – Montevideo.

                            Montevideo has welcomed us with clear blue sky, warm sun and calm sea.  
                            So, I ended up very far from home. Here my people will have to start all over again, completely
                            reset their lives and careers. That's all for now. Peace for everyone.
